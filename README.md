# Listify
A way to check if your lists are valid to other lists

## Example:

Database: a, b, c, d           
Search term: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h

- Yes: 'a' Is in the list
- Yes: 'b' Is in the list
- Yes: 'c' Is in the list
- Yes: 'd' Is in the list
- No: 'e' Is not in the list
- No: 'f' Is not in the list
- No: 'g' Is not in the list
- No: 'h' Is not in the list
